                                <p>My name is Peter and I am a UCSD Coding Bootcamp student. My background in technology
                                    started when I was very young. My dad was a programmer at Microsoft and at an early age
                                    I was exposed to computers and technology (mostly through the form of computer building,
                                    in order to play video games). After I graduated from the University of Washington with
                                    a double degree in Psychology (B.Sc.) and Cinema Studies (B.A.), I worked for three
                                    years at uBreakiFix Seattle. At uBreakiFix, I was a certified Asurion, Samsung, and
                                    Google technician. I did my fair share of hardware repairs on smartphones and tablets,
                                    but my primary specialty was computer repairs; both software and hardware. </p>

                                <p>
                                    After I moved to San Diego, I moved into more of an IT role. At the company I work at
                                    now, I am responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of our workstations, sleep
                                    diagnostic equipment, and servers. This Bootcamp has already taught me so much more than
                                    I ever knew about computers and technology. I hope to be able to apply this knowledge to
                                    transition from a support role to a developer role.
                                </p>
